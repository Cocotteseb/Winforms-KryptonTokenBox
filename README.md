# Winforms-TokenBox

<br>
A Winforms control that can be used as To/CC/CCO field in an email client app, as file attachments field or tags field...
<br>

Although it is usable in its current state (DEC2017), it still has some rought edges and some things are not properly tested. This is my first attempt to build my own control.
<br>
These are some samples:
